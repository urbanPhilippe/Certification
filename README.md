# ABSTRACT

This is my end of study project carried out for a real client. Our team was made up of 4 students from Bordeaux WildCode school, specialized in php Symfony 4.4.
Our customer wanted to develop a web application that follow up the professional integration of new collaborators.
Three types of users are concerned : collaborators, managers and HR department as administrator.
From the front-end point of view, this application is completely responsive. But, a special attention was paid
to use it with desktop computer and provide an intuitive dashboard. By using this application, users can gain
some visibility to the integration process and contribute to its success.
From the back-end point of view, this application allows or denies access according to the roles assigned to
users in the company. The new collaboratorsâ€™ checklist or timeline evolve in light of their arrival date or
entered parameters. Moreover, administrators can update a major part of the contents through a panel of
management.
By focusing on a better communication betwen different actors, visibility and others external factors,
company can expect a double growth of its profits in 2022.
